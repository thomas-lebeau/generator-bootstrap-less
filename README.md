# Generator Bootstrap Less
A Generator for Yeoman to work with the Less version of Twitter Bootstrap


## About
This generator has been redev from scratch to work with Yeoman 1.0
The improvments are:
- Much easier installation process. No needs to install dependencies manually anymore
- Better respect of Yeoman's workflow
- Possibility to include [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome)


## Getting started
- Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed:
    `npm install -g yo`
- Install the generator **locally**: `npm install generator-bootstrap-less`
- Run: `yo bootstrap-less` to scaffold your project
